# Default config for sway
#
# Copy this to ~/.config/sway/config and edit it to your liking.
#
# Read `man 5 sway` for a complete reference.

### Variables
#
# Logo key. Use Mod1 for Alt.
set $mod Mod4
# Home row direction keys, like vim
set $left h
set $down j
set $up k
set $right l
# Your preferred terminal emulator
set $term alacritty
# Your preferred application launcher
# Note: pass the final command to swaymsg so that the resulting window can be opened
# on the original workspace that the command was run on.
set $menu exec bemenu-run

### Output configuration
#
# Default wallpaper (more resolutions are available in /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/)
output * bg /home/korochun/.wallpaper.jpg fill
#
# Example configuration:
#
#   output HDMI-A-1 resolution 1920x1080 position 1920,0
#
# You can get the names of your outputs by running: swaymsg -t get_outputs

### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.

### Input configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#

input "type:keyboard" {
    xkb_layout us,ru
}

#   input "2:14:SynPS/2_Synaptics_TouchPad" {
#       dwt enabled
#       tap enabled
#       natural_scroll enabled
#       middle_emulation enabled
#   }
#
# You can get the names of your inputs by running: swaymsg -t get_inputs
# Read `man 5 sway-input` for more information about this section.

### Key bindings
#
# Basics:
#

# Drag floating windows by holding down $mod and left mouse button.
# Resize them with right mouse button + $mod.
# Despite the name, also works for non-floating windows.
# Change normal to inverse to use left mouse button for resizing and right
# mouse button for dragging.
floating_modifier $mod normal

bindsym --to-code {
    # Start a terminal
    $mod+t exec $term

    # Kill focused window
    $mod+q kill

    # Start your launcher
    $mod+Return exec $menu

    # Reload the configuration file
    $mod+Shift+r reload

    # Exit sway (logs you out of your Wayland session)
    $mod+Shift+e exec swaynag -t warning -m 'You pressed the exit shortcut. Do you really want to exit sway? This will end your Wayland session.' -b 'Yes, exit sway' 'swaymsg exit'
#
# Moving around:
#
    # Move your focus around
    $mod+$left focus left
    $mod+$down focus down
    $mod+$up focus up
    $mod+$right focus right
    # Or use $mod+[up|down|left|right]
    $mod+Left focus left
    $mod+Down focus down
    $mod+Up focus up
    $mod+Right focus right

    # Move the focused window with the same, but add Shift
    $mod+Shift+$left move left
    $mod+Shift+$down move down
    $mod+Shift+$up move up
    $mod+Shift+$right move right
    # Ditto, with arrow keys
    $mod+Shift+Left move left
    $mod+Shift+Down move down
    $mod+Shift+Up move up
    $mod+Shift+Right move right
#
# Layout stuff:
#
    # You can "split" the current object of your focus with
    # $mod+b or $mod+v, for horizontal and vertical splits
    # respectively.
    $mod+b splith
    $mod+v splitv

    # Make the current focus fullscreen
    $mod+f fullscreen

    # Toggle the current focus between tiling and floating mode
    $mod+Shift+space floating toggle
#
# Scratchpad:
#
    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
    # You can send windows there and get them back later.

    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
    $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad

    # Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
    # If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
    $mod+minus scratchpad show

    $mod+r mode "resize"
}
#
# Resizing containers:
#
mode "resize" {
bindsym --to-code {
    # left will shrink the containers width
    # right will grow the containers width
    # up will shrink the containers height
    # down will grow the containers height
    $left resize shrink width 10px
    $down resize grow height 10px
    $up resize shrink height 10px
    $right resize grow width 10px

    # Ditto, with arrow keys
    Left resize shrink width 10px
    Down resize grow height 10px
    Up resize shrink height 10px
    Right resize grow width 10px
